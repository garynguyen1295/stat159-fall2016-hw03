The data/folder contains 4 documents: `Advertising.csv`, `eda-output.txt`, `regression.RData`, `correlation-matrix.RData'

Dataset `Advertising.csv` will be used in this project.  Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani are the authors of the book that contains the source of `Advertising.csv`

## `Advertising.csv`: 

_this dataset is used for the multiple linear regression 


##`eda-output.txt`: 

_ a text file that contains the summary statistics of all the variables, and the correlation matrix. This file was produced by using `sink()` from the `eda-script.R` file.

## `regression.RData`:

_ this file contains the regression objects obtained when running `regression-script.R`. it's produced using `save()` function 	

_ This dataset can be loaded into R by using the function: 'load("data/regression.RData")' in R.

##`correlation-matrix.RData`: 

_  an R's binary format file containing the matrix of correlations among all variables. 

_ This file can be produced by using `save()` from the `eda-script.R` file.
